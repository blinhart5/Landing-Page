# Landing-Page
Html/CSS project for The Odin Project
This was a project that involved applying what I learned so far regarding css/html
to make a landing page. I practiced using flexbox for the layout and got some 
good experience learning how to nest divs in order to get the information structured 
as well as I could to match the example. 
I tried to use what I learned about properly naming elements and classes 
when structuring the html, and think I did alright for a first exercise.
